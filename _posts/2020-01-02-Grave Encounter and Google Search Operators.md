## Grave Encounter and Google Search Operators

Cleaning up my digital notes and files I came across a very old to do list from 2016 containing a link to a short film released in 2011. I'm kind of a completionist, meaning I wanted to cross the item off the list so I could feel productive. I tasked myself to find where to watch it. I didn't find it.
I don't consider it a super useful skill but I do pride myself in being able to find anything on Google. Well, almost anything, this short film took me into a rabbit hole where I found nothing useful except the idea for this post.
I'm documenting here what little information I could gather plus how to use some search operators (they work on other search engines besides Google, try them out!)

### Grave Ecounter and Grave Enconters

The short film in question is called Grave Encounter and it was released on 2011. All you have to do is search for Grave Encounter 2011 and you should be done. Here's the main problem. (Pic)
A film called Grave Encounter**s** was released in 2011 too. This movie is vastly more popular so, of course, the search results are inundated with this instead.
